# reddit-repost-bot
Reddit bot for detecting reposts using opencv.

to-do
 - add text support (easy, maybe)
 - add video support (probably pretty difficult)
 - use database to store keypoints for each image for each subreddit to make it easier to find images that are similar (don't know if this would actually improve performance)
 - host on AWS instance to run all the time (this would require creating a new reddit account for posting)
